  - MATRIX decomposition(QR, spectacular) eigenvalue, eigenvectors, Grim Schmidt <-- still has problem in eignevector converting from decomposition
  - postfix calculator (equation coverter, equation solver)
  - derivative equation for ^n and other <-- didn't finish and were not do anymore b/c consider too many factors
